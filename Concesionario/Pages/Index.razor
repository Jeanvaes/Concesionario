<MudText Class="mb-8">How do I see the technology in 20 years?</MudText>
<MudText class="essay">
Although most people would generally agree that technology has been developing in leaps and bounds, 
leading us to a better world, a few would criticise the impacts that technology could have on the 
development of a country, making developed countries richer at the expense of third-world countries, 
in the other side, technology has made our life better and also our world by making a new way of 
transportation, communication and shaping the world with computers, which I really like, because 
some like just connecting cables and microchips can create what we use every day, a phone, a tv, a computer, 
or something that can work without someone controlling it, its autonomous, like the technology we’re 
developing, machine learning, that is integrated in robots, which seems to be alive. I will be looking 
at the technology 20 years in the future.

The thing is, technology is considered to be a key or a solution for our problems, being it developed the 
fastest way possible, with purpose of making the human’s life better or in other cases less complicated. Despite 
the fact that technology could provide jobs for a specific population of the country, companies are believed to 
generate profit for themselves, getting richer and making countries where they have their factories, poor. 
Furthermore, technology is believed to be in continuous change a cause of our news necessities and goals for 
human race. However, the technology hasn’t reached every place in the world just a few countries have a good 
level of development in that area, while developing countries are trying to get some state-of-the-art technology. 
What I’m saying is that there are a lot of zones where technology hasn’t reached out, and the only key to make the 
world a better place and combating something so important like the climate change, that put us in danger, seems to 
be a business for others who doesn’t care about the development and just about getting rich, seem we are the animals 
that are destroying the world and its resources, at least we should try to survived because at the end the money 
will not make difference.

As a matter of fact, technology has had a profound impact on people’s life thus I believe in the coming years the 
technology will bring new solution for illnesses, transport, construction, entertainment and tools for war. The 
problem often stems from some countries, which have to innovate in war, in some cases just to keep their population
safe, and other countries are doing it just to intimidate, and show their power. So everyone is forced to develop war 
tools because they have to be in the same level of their competitors. We can see that the space exploration is so 
important for a country like US, because they’re competing with Russia. In terms of my opinion and my area of study, 
I supposed computer will be reinvented, because we won’t be able to make them smaller, so here is when analogue 
computers come, and probably they will change how we code, and everything that used to work with a computer nowadays 
will be obsolete, and we will have to recode them to work with the new computer. The programable things will change 
and most likely they will give us a new vision for our future. Another thing take into account are the robots or 
machine learning, it might be the most important tech nowadays because they can do stuff in a more efficient way 
and not making error like humans does, so I supposed that might be the tech that we will be living with in 20 years, 
and I will make our lives probably boring an d easier, because the robot will do everything that human can, I mean 
probably not to think like we do, but programable tasks, they will do it better than us. In the negative part robots 
will be use in war, becoming indestructible soldiers, and here emerges another problem, countries will be more 
aggressive since they now that in every war they won’t lose human lives.

The obvious conclusion to be drawn is that despite the fact that technology is a business for some people and has
a major impact on developing countries, it has allowed us to learn about space exploration, people behaviour, vaccines, 
animals, phenomenon, machine learning, robots and among other things. As far as I’m concerned, technology may have some 
drawbacks that could affect the development of a third-world country, but thanks to technology, the world where we 
are living on seems to be more united. If we take for instance the pandemic, we will see the world was able to continue 
working, probably a low pace, but thanks to techs like the internet, computers, and the globalisation, we were able to
be in contact and carry on with our jobs.
